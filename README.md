# Amicable-Numbers
The program for finding amicable numbers in a user-specified interval.

Theory
-------------------------
Amicable numbers are two different natural numbers related in such a way that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. That is, σ(a)=b and σ(b)=a, where σ(n) is equal to the sum of positive divisors of n.

The smallest pair of amicable numbers is (220, 284). They are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3).

### The first ten amicable pairs are:
1.  **(220, 284)**
2.  **(1184, 1210)**
3.  **(2620, 2924)**
4.  **(5020, 5564)**
5.  **(6232, 6368)**
6.  **(10744, 10856)**
7.  **(12285, 14595)**
8.  **(17296, 18416)**
9.  **(63020, 76084)**
10. **(66928, 66992)**
